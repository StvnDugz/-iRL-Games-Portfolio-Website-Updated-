                <h1> History </h1>
                <p> Founded in 2018 by game designer Steven Duggan, I.R.L. Games is committed to developing broadly
                    accessible, artistic, thought-provoking and fun experiences. Our work includes titles such as
                    En-Trance, ShinoBoy, i-SO and Wave Runner that have appeared on PC and current gen consoles. Today, we are a team of
                    four creative professionals, coming from a broad range of experience and education. Our hope is to
                    expand the range of experiences possible in video games so that they can be enjoyed and loved by
                    people of all ages, cultures and backgrounds. We are hard at work on bringing our games
                    to more players - and on making new ones.</p>

                <p> Our studio uses a unique approach through experimentation, iteration and collaboration to create an
                    entertaining experience. We take pride in making games that are intutitive and enjoyed by everyone.
                    We are designers, artists, musicians, writers and creators trying to make an impact and positive
                    change with our games. Our team is made up of a mix of diverse talent and experience.</p>
